### 1. **Time Complexity of HashMap Operations**

Assuming a **good hash function** (i.e., it uniformly distributes keys across the map) and using **closed addressing** (separate chaining) to handle collisions:

- **Insertion**:
  - **Best case**: **O(1)** (constant time). If there’s no collision, the key is hashed and directly stored at the calculated index.
  - **Worst case**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the HashMap. This happens when all keys hash to the same index, forming a long chain (e.g., if the hash function is poor).
  - **Average case**: **O(1)** with a good hash function and low collision probability.

- **Search (Lookup)**:
  - **Best case**: **O(1)** if there is no collision and the key is found at the hashed index directly.
  - **Worst case**: **O(n)** if all keys hash to the same index and we have to search through the chain.
  - **Average case**: **O(1)** with uniform distribution and a good hash function.

- **Deletion**:
  - **Best case**: **O(1)**, where the key is found directly without collisions.
  - **Worst case**: **O(n)** if we have to search through a chain in case of many collisions.
  - **Average case**: **O(1)** with proper distribution.

### 2. **Space Complexity of HashMap**

- **Best case**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements. In this case, each element gets its own index without chaining.
- **Worst case**: **O(n + m)**, where:
  - `n` is the number of elements.
  - `m` is the number of buckets (allocated space for the HashMap).
  - In the worst case, many chains form, leading to a higher memory overhead due to the storage of linked lists at each index.

### 3. **Effect of Collisions on Time Complexity**

When **collisions** happen, the time complexity can degrade, especially if many keys map to the same index:

- **Without collisions**: Each operation (insertion, search, deletion) takes **O(1)** on average.
- **With collisions**: If all keys collide and form a chain at a single index, the time complexity degrades to **O(n)** for that specific index. This happens in the worst-case scenario, where the hash function is poor, or the load factor is too high (too many elements relative to the size of the map).

---

### 4. **Load Factor and Rehashing**

- **Load factor**: The ratio of the number of elements (`n`) to the number of buckets (`m`).
  - Load factor = `n / m`
  - A **high load factor** increases the chance of collisions, leading to longer chains and slower operations.
  
- **Rehashing**: When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the HashMap can **resize** (rehash). This involves:
  - **Doubling the number of buckets** and reassigning keys to new buckets using a new hash function.
  - **Time complexity of rehashing**: **O(n)**, since every element must be rehashed and moved to the new buckets.

---

### 5. **Complexity of Operations with Closed Addressing**

In closed addressing, where collisions are handled using separate chaining, the time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search is influenced by the **load factor**:

- **Average case**: **O(1 + α)**, where `α` is the **load factor**.
  - When the load factor is small, operations are almost constant time.
  - As `α` increases, the chances of collisions increase, making the operations slower (up to **O(n)** in the worst case).

---

### Summary of Time Complexities:

| Operation  | Best Case | Worst Case | Average Case |
|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Insertion  | O(1)      | O(n)       | O(1)         |
| Search     | O(1)      | O(n)       | O(1)         |
| Deletion   | O(1)      | O(n)       | O(1)         |

- **Best case**: When there are no collisions.
- **Worst case**: When all elements collide and form long chains.
- **Average case**: Depends on the hash function and load factor, but generally O(1) for a well-balanced HashMap.
